# Book_Recommendation_syestem.
This book recommendation project is aimed at creating a recommendation system for book lovers. The system uses a collaborative filtering technique to suggest books to users based on their preferences and ratings. It involves collecting and preprocessing data, building a model, and deploying it as a web application using Flask.
